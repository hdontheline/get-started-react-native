#Learn the basics
    React Native is like React, but it uses native components instead of web components as building blocks

    import, from, class, and extends in the example above are all ES2015 features
    https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/

    <View><Text>Hello world!</Text></View>. This is JSX - a syntax for embedding XML within JavaScript.
    <Text> is a built-in component that just displays some text and View is like the <div> or <span>.

    So this code is defining HelloWorldApp, a new Componentthe only thing that's required is a render function which returns some JSX to render.
