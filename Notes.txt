Installed React-Native using homebrew.

I did come across an issue when starting this as I installed node.js incorrectly. 
    Had to uninstall it completely from my Mac machine to begin this setup again using homebrew.

#Learn the basics
    React Native is like React, but it uses native components instead of web components as building blocks

    import, from, class, and extends in the example above are all ES2015 features
    https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/

    <View><Text>Hello world!</Text></View>. This is JSX - a syntax for embedding XML within JavaScript.
    <Text> is a built-in component that just displays some text and View is like the <div> or <span>.

    So this code is defining HelloWorldApp, a new Componentthe only thing that's required is a render function which returns some JSX to render.


#Props
    Most components can be customized when they are created, with different parameters. These creation parameters are called props.
    For example, one basic React Native component is the Image. When you create an image, you can use a prop named source to control what image it shows.

    braces surrounding {pic} - these embed the variable pic into JSX. You can put any JavaScript expression inside braces in JSX.

    Your own components can also use props. This lets you make a single component that is used in many different places in your app, with slightly different properties in each place. Just refer to this.props in your render function.

    A View is useful as a container for other components, to help control style and layout.    

    With props and the basic Text, Image, and View components, you can build a wide variety of static screens.
